# The Builder's Audit: Permission Notification Interactive Flow

**Agent**: The Builder -- Pragmatic full-stack developer who will actually implement this
**Overall Rating**: 3.2/5 - Moderate complexity, significant unknowns
**Date**: 2026-02-09

## Executive Summary

Feature is **implementable** but requires architectural research and careful phased rollout. The core technical capabilities exist (webhook message editing, message ID tracking), but critical unknowns around Claude Code's event system create significant implementation risk.

**Recommended Approach:** Implement Phase 1 immediately (low risk), defer Phase 2 until event availability is confirmed, skip Phase 3 initially (architectural complexity).
